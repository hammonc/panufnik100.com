<h2>CLARE HAMMOND</h2>

<p>Acclaimed by The Daily Telegraph as a pianist of “amazing power and panache”, Clare Hammond has performed across Europe, Russia and Canada and appears regularly at the Wigmore Hall in London, and the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester. Her Purcell Room debut for the Park Lane Group concert series was praised by The Guardian for its “crisp precision and unflashy intelligence”. A passionate advocate of twentieth and twenty-first century music, Clare combines a formidable technique and virtuosic flair onstage with stylistic integrity and attention to detail.</p> <p>In recent years, Clare has performed at St George’s Hall Bristol, the Queen’s Hall Edinburgh, and the Bridgewater Hall Manchester. Her Wigmore Hall recital in 2012 was broadcast by BBC Radio 3 as part of their ‘Live in Concert’ programme, chosen as one of their Classical Highlights for the month and later broadcast on Radio 4 in the Netherlands. Clare released her debut CD of British contemporary piano music in 2012 for Prima Facie Records, and appeared on BBC Radio 3’s ‘In Tune’ to promote the disc. In October she visited Radio Ulster to discuss recently discovered pieces by Hamilton Harty of which she gave the world premiere in her inaugural recital as Artist-in-Residence at Queen’s University Belfast, while 2013 opened with a broadcast of six études by Unsuk Chin on BBC Radio 3’s ‘Hear and Now’.</p><p>Highlights in 2013 include the premieres of works written especially for Clare by Kenneth Hesketh and Robert Saxton at Cheltenham and the City of London Festivals, performances at the Brighton and Presteigne Festivals, recitals at the Wigmore and Bridgewater Halls, and three BBC broadcasts. Clare has just embarked on a new collaboration with BIS records and recorded two discs for them in September 2013: one of the complete solo piano works of Andrzej and Roxanna Panufnik and the other of études by Unsuk Chin, Karol Szymanowski, Nikolai Kapustin and Sergei Lyapunov. An active chamber musician, Clare has worked with Andrew Kennedy, Jennifer Pike, Philippe Graffin, Lawrence Power, Ruth Palmer, Sara Trickey and the Endellion, Dante and Badke String Quartets. She performs regularly with the cellist Richard Birchall and with the Goldfield Ensemble.</p> <p>Eager to extend the boundaries of traditional concert life, Clare is intrigued by new perspectives that musicological study can bring to bear on performance. She completed a doctorate on twentieth-century left-hand piano concertos in 2012 and was artist-in-residence at Queen’s University Belfast in 2012-13. Clare is also in demand as a speaker and has been invited to give presentations at Oxford, Manchester, and Surrey Universities this season. On the concert circuit, she enjoys introducing recitals, pre and post concert talks, and giving lecture recitals and workshops to audiences of all levels.</p><p>Clare completed a BA at Cambridge University, where she obtained a double first in music, and undertook postgraduate study with Ronan O’Hora at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama and with Professor Rhian Samuel at City University London. She is grateful for the support of the Fidelio Trust, Musicians’ Benevolent Fund, RVW Trust, the Vernon Ellis Foundation and the Stradivari Trust. Clare is represented by Liz Webb Management.
