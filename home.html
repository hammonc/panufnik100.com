	<h2>Sunday 30 November 2014, Kings Place</h2>

	<p>Forged in the fires of the two World Wars, Sir Andrzej Panufnik's compositional output is inextricably linked with the major social and political events of the 20th century. Born in Warsaw at the onset of the First World War, he lived through the German occupation of the city in the Second World War and participated in musical resistance activities with the composer Lutosławski. Over the course of the conflict, Panufnik lost many of his closest relatives and saw his compositions consumed by the fires of the Warsaw Uprising.  Initially fêted by the socialist government, he became unable to compose suitably 'positive' music and, accused of bourgeois decadence, made a dramatic escape to Britain in 1954.</p>

	<p>This Centenary Celebration will present chamber works spanning his life from his piano trio (1934), reconstructed after the war, and his ‘vocalise’ Dreamscape (1977), to his three string quartets (written between 1976 and 1990) to be performed by the Brodsky Quartet, ‘resident quartet’ at Kings Place.</p>

	<p>The programmes will be interspersed with works by composers who inspired him - Mozart, Gesualdo and Purcell - and some complementary pieces by his daughter Roxanna including the London Première of a new quartet written for the Brodskys. The Celebration will culminate with a Cabaret Evening, recreating the atmosphere of the Warsaw 'Sztuka i Moda' Café in the 1930s and ‘40s. </p>
