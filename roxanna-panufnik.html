<h2>ROXANNA PANUFNIK</h2>

<p><em>"We've been planning this special day for years - it has all the ingredients for a 100th Birthday musical party with the finest performers and spine-tingling repertoire. I'm particularly looking forward to the Cabaret evening and seeing a side of my father that I never really knew… I really hope as many of you as possible can come and party with us!"</em></p>

<p>Roxanna Panufnik b.1968 ARAM, GRSM(hons), LRAM studied composition at the Royal Academy of Music and, since then, has written a wide range of pieces – opera, ballet, music theatre, choral works, chamber compositions, and music for film and television – which have been performed all over the world.</p><p>Highlights of her works include “Westminster Mass”, commissioned for Westminster Cathedral Choir on the occasion of Cardinal Hume's 75th birthday; “The Music Programme”, an opera for Polish National Opera's millennium season which received its UK premiere at the BOC Covent Garden Festival; and settings for solo voices and orchestra of Vikram Seth's “Beastly Tales” - the first of which was commissioned by the BBC for Patricia Rozario and City of London Sinfonia.
