<h2>JACQUI DANKWORTH</h2>

<p><em>"Paul Cassidy introduced both Charlie and me to the Panufnik project. I am thrilled to be a part of  the evening for many reasons. I like Andrzej Panufnik's writing very much as it has quirkiness and originality but also great romanticism. I also feel a lot of empathy with Roxanna, being a musician and writer whose father was a prolific and brilliant composer. I am delighted to be part of the evening and feel honoured to be performing these wonderful songs."</em></p>
