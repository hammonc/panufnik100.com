			<h3>Andrzej Panufnik</h3>
			<p>Andrzej Panufnik was born in 1914 in Warsaw and grew up in a musical family, beginning to compose at the age of nine. He gained his diploma at the Warsaw State Conservatoire and travelled to Vienna to study conducting with Felix Weingartner, and to Paris and London for further composition studies. At the outbreak of war he returned to Warsaw where he remained throughout the Nazi occupation. In 1954 Panufnik left Poland as a protest against political control over creative artists, resulting in the total supression of his name and music. He settled in England and subsequently gained British nationality. In 1977, after a 23-year long silence, Panufnik's music was once again heard in Poland, and in 1990 the composer made a momentous return to his native country to conduct a programme of his works to open the Warsaw Autumn Festival.The composer received a British knighthood in January 1991, and following his death nine months later was awarded a Polish knighthood by President Lech Walesa.</p>

			<h3>Clare Hammond</h3>
			<p>Acclaimed by The Daily Telegraph as a pianist of “amazing power and panache”, Clare Hammond broadcasts regularly on BBC Radio 3 and, in 2013, made her recital debuts at the City of London, Cheltenham, Brighton and Presteigne Festivals. She has recently recorded two discs for BIS records, one of the complete piano works of Andzrej and Roxanna Panufnik, and performs regularly at the Wigmore and Bridgewater Halls. Her Purcell Room debut for the Park Lane Group concert series was praised by The Guardian for its “crisp precision and unflashy intelligence”. A passionate advocate of twentieth and twenty-first century music, Clare combines a formidable technique and virtuosic flair onstage with stylistic integrity and attention to detail. </p>
